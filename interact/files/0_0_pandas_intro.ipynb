    "# Pandas from Numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By Matthew Brett and Peter Rush\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will show the fundamental structure of pandas Data Frames. We will look at the components that constitute a Data Frame - for instance, numpy arrays - in order to gain a deeper understanding of the raw ingredients that more advanced pandas methods and functions operate on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is an open-source python library for data manipulation and analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Why is Pandas called Pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "The “Pandas” name is short for “panel data”. The library was named after the type of econometrics panel data that it was designed to analyse. [Panel data](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwijqt63p9eMAxUExzgGHcYrLE8QFnoECCIQAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPanel_data%23%3A~%3Atext%3DPanel%2520data%2520is%2520a%2520subset%2Ctime%2520point%2520for%2520the%2520latter.&usg=AOvVaw2LP6yj5mwB4_1164F8n-Bt&opi=89978449) is longitudinal data where the same observational units (e.g. countries) are observed over multiple instances across time. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The pandas Data Frame is the most important feature of the pandas library. Data Frames, as the name suggests, contain not only the data for an analysis, but a toolkit of methods for cleaning, plotting and interacting with the data in flexible ways. For more information about pandas see [this page](https://pandas.pydata.org/about/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, we ask Pandas to create Data Frames by reading a data file (like a `.csv` file) Before we do that however, we will build our own Data Frame from scratch, beginning with the fundamental building block for Data Frames: Numpy arrays."
