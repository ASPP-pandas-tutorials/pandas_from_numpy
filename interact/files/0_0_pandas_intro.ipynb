    "\n",
    "**Why is Pandas called Pandas?**\n",

    "type of econometrics panel data that it was designed to analyse. [Panel\n",
    "data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panel_data) are longitudinal data where\n",
    "the same observational units (e.g. countries) are observed over multiple\n",
    "instances across time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**End of note**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pandas Data Frame is the most important feature of the Pandas library. Data Frames, as the name suggests, contain not only the data for an analysis, but a toolkit of methods for cleaning, plotting and interacting with the data in flexible ways. For more information about Pandas see [this page](https://Pandas.pydata.org/about/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard way to make a new Data Frame is to ask Pandas to read a data file\n",
    "(like a `.csv` file) into a Data Frame. Before we do that however, we will\n",
