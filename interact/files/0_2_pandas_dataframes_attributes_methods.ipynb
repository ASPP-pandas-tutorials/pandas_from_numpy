    "Data Frames are *dictionary-like collections of Series*. Series are a combination of a Numpy array (`.values`) with other attributes (`name` and `index`). As a result, many methods we can use on a Series are similar to those available from Numpy arrays, and many Data Frame methods likewise parallel those from the Pandas Series that constitute the Data Frame."
