# Todo

We haven't covered:

* slices in row or column `.loc` indexing.  The slice *includes* the stop
  value.
* direct indexing Data Frames with sequences.

Both of these should go in page 0_1, I guess, along with a discussion of Pandas
indexing hygiene.

* Stop included in loc slice.
* Exercise on loc stopping with datetimes (perhaps not what they're expecting).
