# Todo

Consider exercises on:

* Stop included in loc slice.
* loc stopping with Timestamps (perhaps not what they're expecting).

We could have covered `.drop` more.

Something on `pd.concat` would be useful.

Maybe we could move the `.name` discussion in the `.loc` / `.iloc` page to the
creating Data Frames page.
